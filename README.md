# 👋🏾 Hello, I'm Patrick

**`Cybersecurity • Software Engineering • IT Operations`**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about building and breaking things to better understand how they work — and ultimately, how to secure them. I use this space to document my journey, share hands-on cybersecurity labs, and collaborate with others who love tech as much as I do.

Feel free to browse my repositories and reach out if you want to connect or collaborate!

## 📖 About Me

My journey into tech began shortly after high school during quarantine, when I started teaching myself software development. That curiosity led me to attend General Assembly, where I dove into web development. Over time, I became increasingly drawn to the infrastructure side — wanting to understand not just how apps work, but *why* they work and how to protect them.

Today, I’m focused on cybersecurity. My projects reflect a hands-on approach to both red and blue team concepts — from privilege escalation and enumeration to log analysis and SIEM tuning using industry-standard tools.
